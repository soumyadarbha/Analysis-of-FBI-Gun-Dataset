# Analysis-of-FBI-Gun-Dataset

Project Description:

In this project, We will be working on the data taken from the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System. The NICS isused by to determine whether a prospective buyer is eligible to buy firearms or explosives. Gun shops call into this system to ensure thateach customer does not have a criminal record or isn’t otherwise ineligible to make a purchase. The data has been supplemented withstate level data from census.gov. We will be creating data visualizations using this dataset.

Data Used:

The data comes from the FBI's National Instant Criminal Background Check System. The NICS is used by to determine whether aprospective buyer is eligible to buy firearms or explosives. Gun shops call into this system to ensure that each customer does not have acriminal record or isn’t otherwise ineligible to make a purchase. The data has been supplemented with state level data from census.gov.

Technologies Used:

Plotly Express is a new high-level Python visualization library: it’s a wrapper for Plotly.py that exposes a simple syntax for complex charts.Inspired by Seaborn and ggplot2, it was specifically designed to have a terse, consistent and easy-to-learn API: with just a single import,you can make richly interactive plots in just a single function call, including faceting, maps, animations, and trendlines.
